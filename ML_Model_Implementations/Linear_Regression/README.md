# Linear Regression From Scratch (NumPy)

This is for remembering the mechanics of linear regression and minibatch gradient descent, not on building a production model.

## Overview

- Dataset: California Housing
- Task: Regression
- Goal: Implement linear regression from scratch in NumPy and verify correctness against 'sklearn.LinearRegression'.


## Results (Test Set)

**NumPy implementation**
- MAE: ~0.53
- RMSE: ~0.72
- R^2: ~0.61

sklearn LinearRegression
- MAE: ~0.53
- RMSE: ~0.72
- R^2: ~0.61

The close match confirms the from scratch implementation is correct.
